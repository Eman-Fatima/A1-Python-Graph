# A1-Python-Graph

Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy. In this assignment, I plotted two-graph using matplot library in Jupiter Notebook. 
1)	Firstly, I import required libraries e.g NumPy, matplotlib 
2)	Loaded the csv file data from local folder in my PC into array using NumPy library, then unpacked the values of csv file in ‘x’ and ‘y’ and at the end specified the delimiter, in this the delimiter is comma (,)
3)	Apply ’ggplot’ style for more graphical representation from matplotlib library
4)	Plotted the chart from given values in array
5)	Plotted bar chart on same data using various colors
